    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Founded in 2010 by Ruth Koup, My PA House Search was built on the belief that every client deserves
      white-glove service, transparent guidance, and deep local expertise. From first homes to luxury estates,
      our goal is to simplify the process, maximize your results, and build lifelong relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past decade we’ve grown from a solo consultancy to a full Keller Williams team,
      closing over 500 transactions across Harrisburg, Mechanicsburg, Lancaster, Carlisle, York, and beyond.
      Yet our core values—integrity, empathy, excellence, and community—remain as strong as ever.
