    <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
    <p>
      My PA House Search started in 2010 when founder <strong>Ruth Koup</strong> recognized that homebuyers and sellers
      needed more than just listings—they needed guidance, transparency, and local expertise.
      What began as a one-woman consultancy in a shared office has grown into a full-service team
      at Keller Williams Realty, serving families across Harrisburg, Mechanicsburg, Lancaster, and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on, Ruth’s mission was simple: treat every client like family. Sales were modest, but
      word-of-mouth referrals fueled steady growth. By 2012, the team had helped over 50 households
      find or sell homes, establishing a reputation for personalized service and community focus.
